# Development

Models and loaders live in [trace-ingest](packages/trace-ingest/README.md).
`uv sync` installs the workspace packages locally.

## Validation

When adding NVIDIA-authored files or changing dependencies, update the tracked
licensing artifacts first:

```bash
make update-copyright-headers
make update-licenses
```

For dependency changes, run `uv add <package>` and `make update-licenses`, review
the generated diff, and commit it. Generation requires `osv-scanner` 2.3.3 on `PATH`
and automatically collects license and attribution texts for locked runtime
dependencies and all extras into `third_party/NOTICES.txt`, with indexes in
`THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md` and `third_party/licenses.jsonl`.

Only exceptions require manual work: if a distribution omits its license, add a
version-specific, checksum-pinned upstream document in `third_party/license_exceptions.yaml`.
Unknown license terms require a shared text under `third_party/license_texts/` and,
where necessary, a reviewed compatibility entry in `third_party/license_overrides.yaml`.
The standard texts were sourced from SPDX license-list-data commit
`16f3aa6c3bdd62e50f8b1cf618f32d2a510250ee`; original package notices are retained separately.

`make check-licenses` verifies the generated disclosures. Scanner intermediates and
download caches live in ignored `tmp/`; a cold cache requires network access.
These notices cover this source/Python distribution;
shipping containers or bundled native environments requires collecting notices from
those actual artifacts too, since platform wheels can bundle additional libraries.

Ruff requires annotations outside tests. ty uses its defaults and checks all Python
files, including tests.

Run the same read-only checks used by CI:

```bash
uv lock --check
make check-copyright-headers
make check-licenses
uv run --locked ruff check .
uv run --locked ruff format --check .
uv run --locked ty check
uv run --locked pytest
uv build --all-packages
```

## Publish an internal release candidate

The package version is a PEP 440 release candidate such as `0.1.0rc1`. Put the internal
Artifactory upload endpoint and your access or identity token in the gitignored `.env`:

```dotenv
ARTIFACTORY_PYPI_URL=<internal-artifactory-pypi-upload-url>
ARTIFACTORY_TOKEN=<token>
```

Use the full token from Artifactory. The accompanying reference token is a shorter alias and is
not needed by this publisher.

Build and validate without uploading:

```bash
uv run tools/publish_artifactory.py --dry-run
```

Publish the wheel to internal Artifactory:

```bash
uv run tools/publish_artifactory.py
```

The script builds a clean wheel, rejects environment files, refuses non-NVIDIA upload endpoints,
disables trusted/public publishing, uploads with `uv publish`, submits SHA-1 and SHA-256 client
checksums, downloads the resulting artifact, and verifies its SHA-256 checksum. It refuses to
overwrite an existing version with different bytes and then prints the direct wheel URL to register
with nSpect. It refuses non-RC versions.

Both CLI forms are supported after installing the wheel:

```bash
insight-agent --version
python -m insight_agent --version
```
