# Analyze MLflow traces

Choose an experiment containing your agent’s traces. Recorded, named assessments
are included automatically in evaluation failure analysis.

## Connect and run

From the [repository root](../../README.md#start-here):

```bash
uv sync --locked --extra mlflow
```

[Configure your inference model and key](../model-access.md#choose-a-model).
If your tracking server requires authentication, add a bearer token to `.env`:

```dotenv
MLFLOW_TRACKING_TOKEN=your-tracking-token
```

For HTTP Basic authentication, use `MLFLOW_TRACKING_USERNAME` and
`MLFLOW_TRACKING_PASSWORD` instead.

Save this as `config.yaml`, replacing the experiment name and tracking URL:

```yaml
max_tokens: 16384
trace:
  max_traces: 100
  mlflow_experiment:
    experiment: my-agent
    tracking_uri: https://mlflow.example.com
```

```bash
uv run --no-sync insight-agent --config config.yaml
```

Open `insights.yml` if the run produced insights. [Read your results](../results.md)
for help with findings or skipped checks.

## Narrow the input

Add `filter: "trace.status = 'ERROR'"` under `trace.mlflow_experiment` to select failed traces.
`tracking_uri` overrides `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI` in the environment.

Keep an explicit limit for a first run. Without one, the live loader defaults to 10,000 traces,
fetched in pages of up to 500. Memory use grows with the number and size of traces.

## Use an export

With tracking-server access configured in the shell, export complete traces:

```bash
uv run --no-sync mlflow traces search \
  --experiment-id YOUR_EXPERIMENT_ID --max-results 100 --output json > mlflow-traces.json
```

Replace the `trace` section with:

```yaml
trace:
  max_traces: 100
  mlflow_export:
    path: mlflow-traces.json
```

Rerun the same analysis command. Local loading needs inference credentials only.
Exports must include spans. The loader accepts native trace objects, arrays, JSONL,
`mlflow traces get` output, and `Trace.to_json()` or `Trace.to_dict()` output.
It validates the entire file before applying the limit; export continuation tokens are not followed.

The extra installs `mlflow-skinny` SDK `>=3.6,<4`. Exports must be readable by that SDK;
tracking-server compatibility depends on your deployment. Duplicate active assessment names
are rejected, so each assessment must have an unambiguous name.
