# Analyze LangSmith traces

Choose a project whose agent behavior you want to understand. Recorded feedback on
root and child runs is included automatically in evaluation failure analysis.

The live adapter supports the v1 query API, tested with self-hosted LangSmith 0.15.
The SmithDB-backed v2 query API is not yet supported.

## Connect and run

With [uv and Git installed](../../README.md#start-here), install the CLI with LangSmith support:

```bash
uv tool install --python 3.12 \
  'insight-agent[langsmith] @ git+https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/labs-trace-intel.git@main'
```

[Configure your inference model and key](../model-access.md#choose-a-model).
Add your LangSmith key to `.env`:

```dotenv
LANGSMITH_API_KEY=your-langsmith-key
```

Save this as `config.yaml`, replacing the project name:

```yaml
max_tokens: 16384
trace:
  max_traces: 100
  langsmith:
    project: my-agent
```

```bash
insight-agent --config config.yaml
```

Open `insights.yml` if the run produced insights. [Read your results](../results.md)
for help with findings or skipped checks.

## Narrow the input

Add fields under `trace.langsmith` as needed:

| Field | Example | What it selects |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `start_time` | `2026-09-01T00:00:00Z` | Traces starting at or after a timezone-aware timestamp. |
| `filter` | `'eq(status, "error")'` | Matching root runs. |
| `tree_filter` | `'eq(run_type, "tool")'` | Complete traces with a matching run anywhere in the tree. |
| `api_url` | `https://langsmith.example.com` | A regional or self-hosted API endpoint. |

`api_url` overrides `LANGSMITH_ENDPOINT`. Set `LANGSMITH_WORKSPACE_ID` in `.env`
if your key needs an explicit workspace. The default limit is 100 complete traces.

## Use an export

With the separate LangSmith CLI installed and authenticated, export complete traces:

```bash
langsmith trace export exports/langsmith --project my-agent --limit 100 --full
```

Replace the `trace` section with:

```yaml
trace:
  max_traces: 100
  langsmith_trace_export_file:
    path: exports/langsmith
```

Rerun the same analysis command. Local exports need inference credentials only.
Use `--full` to include child runs. The loader accepts one `.jsonl` file or a directory
of immediate `.jsonl` files and validates the complete export before applying the limit.
Both paths use Python SDK `>=0.12,<0.13`, installed by the extra.
